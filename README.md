# Principles of Artificial Intelligence Coursework

This repository contains my implementation for the Principles of AI coursework, consisting of two main components:

1. **Linear Regression**: Predicting California housing prices using Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Human Activity Recognition using smartphone sensor data, converting a 6-class problem into binary classification.

## Directory Structure
- `linear_regression/`: Code and documentation for the California Housing dataset analysis
- `svm/`: Code and documentation for the Human Activity Recognition task
- `UCI HAR Dataset/`: Dataset for the SVM part of the assignment

## Setup
See each subdirectory's README.md for specific implementation details.
